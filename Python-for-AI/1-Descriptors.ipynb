    "\n",
    "### 🔹 1. What is a Descriptor?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **descriptor** is a special Python object that customizes what happens when you access, set, or delete a class attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "It defines one or more of these methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `__get__(self, instance, owner)`\n",
    "* `__set__(self, instance, value)`\n",
    "* `__delete__(self, instance)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as a reusable way to **control access to attributes**, often used when you want to **enforce rules or inject behavior** into class attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 2. Real-life Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a **smart plug** that controls how electricity flows into your appliance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Before electricity flows, it checks the voltage and only allows it if it's safe.\n",
    "* Similarly, descriptors can **control what happens when an attribute is accessed or modified**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 3. Real-life Application in AI/ML\n",
    "\n",
    "In a deep learning library like **TensorFlow**, variables like `learning_rate` or `batch_size` might need strict validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You wouldn’t want a negative batch size or a string as the learning rate.\n",
    "* A descriptor can **enforce that constraint automatically**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class PositiveFloat:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __get__(self, instance, owner):\n",
    "        return instance.__dict__[self.name]\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __set__(self, instance, value):\n",
    "        if not isinstance(value, float) or value <= 0:\n",
    "            raise ValueError(f\"{self.name} must be a positive float\")\n",
    "        instance.__dict__[self.name] = value\n",
    "\n",
    "class ModelHyperparams:\n",
    "    learning_rate = PositiveFloat('learning_rate')\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, learning_rate):\n",
    "        self.learning_rate = learning_rate\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "params = ModelHyperparams(0.01)\n",
    "print(params.learning_rate)  # ✅ Works fine\n",
    "\n",
    "params.learning_rate = -0.1  # ❌ Raises ValueError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 4. Why This Matters in AI Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **custom training pipeline**, you might:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Build classes that represent configuration settings.\n",
    "* Use descriptors to **automate validation**, preventing silly bugs like `learning_rate=\"high\"` or `dropout=-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frameworks like **PyTorch Lightning**, **FastAI**, or **LangChain** use similar techniques under the hood to manage configs, environments, and module hooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 5. How to Think About It\n",
    "\n",
    "> Descriptors let you *wrap logic around attributes* — reading, writing, or deleting them — just like decorators wrap logic around functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! Let’s now dive into the **second advanced Python concept**, explained clearly and tailored to **AI/ML and Agentic systems**.\n",

    "# ✅ Concept 2: **Metaclasses** — Step by Step\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 1. What is a Metaclass?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **metaclass** is like a *class of a class*. Just as classes create instances, **metaclasses create classes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If classes are factories for objects, then **metaclasses are factories for classes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A metaclass controls **how a class is built** — you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Automatically modify class attributes,\n",
    "* Enforce rules (e.g., all methods must be async),\n",
    "* Inject behavior into classes **at the time they are created**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 2. Real-life Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a **blueprint factory**. You don't just build houses (objects); you build **the blueprint** (class) that will be used to build houses. A metaclass allows you to **alter the blueprint before any houses are built**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 3. Real-life Application in AI/ML\n",
    "\n",
    "In frameworks like **PyTorch** or **LangChain**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You define components like `Agent`, `Chain`, or `Module`.\n",
    "* A metaclass can ensure all subclasses have a required method like `run()`, or automatically register the component in a plugin system or registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables **plug-and-play architectures**, like those used in AI agents (Auto-GPT, LangGraph, OpenAgents).\n",
    "\n",

    "### 🔹 4. Why This Matters in AI Projects\n",

    "Agent frameworks like LangChain, CrewAI, or Auto-GPT use **registry patterns** powered by metaclasses to:\n",
